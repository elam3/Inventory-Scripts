    Logistics for Inventory
----------------------------------------

1. Upload all csv files to this directory
2. RUN ./getInv.SH clean
    - to remove previous session files
3. RUN catcsv.SH
    - convert end line files from dos to unix format
    - append a newline character to the EOF for each csv files
    - read and append all csv files into one main file -- inv_MMDD.csv
    - where MM is the 2 digit month, and DD is 2 digit day of month
4. RUN ./getInv.SH inv_MMDD.csv
    - this will be a dry run, no changes are made to the database
    - a backup file is made
    - save the error log if needed
    - save the output.csv, this is used for RECONCILE purposes
5. RUN ./getInv.SH --WET inv_MMDD.csv
    - this will make changes to the database
    - first setting all products to 0 stock
    - then adding counted values in


6. Generate the reconcilement report:
    RUN python reconcile.py Inv*.csv
	- assumes the existence of the file 'output.csv' (generated from getInv.SH)
	- input file arguments are the uploaded CSV files from google sheets
